                Proteins are an important part of our daily diet. They provide
                our muscles, cells and other vital tissues with the growth
                factors that are required to keep them healthy and functioning
                normally.
                <br />
                <br />
                In India, a large proportion of individuals prefer to follow a
                vegetarian diet. While this is a highly nutritious diet, it can
                sometimes be low in certain elements such as vitamin B12 and
                proteins.
                <br />

                  The Need For Protein
                </h2>
                Proteins are basically made of building blocks called amino
                acids. Amino acids are essential for cell growth and development
                throughout our lifetime. Proteins form the basic structure of
                not just our vital organs, but also our skin, hair and numerous
                other important parts of our body.
                <br />
                <br />
                If we consume lesser quantities of protein, we could lose muscle
                strength and muscle mass and become weaker. For individuals who
                are recovering from a medical illness, a high protein intake
                often helps in faster recovery.

                  1. Lentils
                </h2>
                Lentils, also called daal, is a popular addition to an everyday
                meal in India. Each cup of lentils contains about 18 g of
                protein making it an excellent source of vegetarian protein.
                Lentils can be had in the form of soups or can be eaten with
                rotis or even rice.
                <br />
                <br />
                In addition to protein, lentils also contain a good quantity of
                fibre which can help maintain healthy bacteria within the gut.
                There is some understanding that regular consumption of lentils
                may also reduce the risk of developing heart disease and cancer.

                  2. Legumes
                </h2>
                Legumes include varieties of beans such as kidney beans, black
                beans, chickpeas and similar ones that are widely considered to
                be a powerhouse of proteins. Chickpeas contain about 15 g of
                protein per serving and also contains numerous other elements
                and minerals that can keep you healthy, strong and fit. Clinical
                studies also found that regular consumption of legumes can help
                keep cholesterol levels low.
                <br />
                <br />
                Chickpeas and other legumes are great in salads or in the form
                of low-fat, low salt curries.

                  3. Nuts
                </h2>
                Nuts are basically superfoods. If you wish to follow a good veg
                protein diet, you should strongly consider adding nuts to the
                cavalry. Nuts such as almonds and cashew nuts are an excellent
                source of protein and are always included in the protein foods
                veg list.

                  4. Green Peas
                </h2>
                You wouldn’t think to look at it, but green peas are an
                excellent source of protein. A cup full of these green beauties
                gives you nearly 9 g of protein. In addition to this, they are
                rich in vitamins A, K and C and also contain numerous minerals
                and a high quantity of fibre. Simply including green peas in
                your daily vegetarian diet can help give you the additional
                protein your body requires.

                  5. Quinoa
                </h2>
                Quinoa is gradually catching on in India as a food that is
                healthy, low in fat and high in protein. Each cup of quinoa can
                provide around 9 grams of protein and is excellent for those who
                suffer from diabetes. They are rich in dietary fibre, which can
                help in keeping the blood sugar levels under control. Their
                glycemic index (GI) is 53. Keeping in mind that GI of 55 or
                below is considered low, quinoa is an ideal food that can be
                included in a diabetic diet plan.

                  6. Soy Milk
                </h2>
                Of late, there is been a fair amount of advertising regarding
                soy milk as a good source of protein and this is entirely true.
                There are many individuals who are intolerant to lactose who
                require an alternative source of protein, and soy milk is a
                great one, containing nearly 7 g of protein per cup. But it is
                not just the protein that makes soy milk an excellent food; it
                is also a good source of calcium, vitamin B12 and vitamin D.

                  7. Oats
                </h2>
                There is no doubt that oats are superfoods. Not only are they
                high in protein but they are a powerhouse of soluble fibre and
                clinically proven to help reduce the risk of developing heart
                disease and to lower cholesterol. A small cup of oats can
                provide you with nearly 6 g of protein and quarter your daily
                requirement of fibre. They also help regulate blood sugar
                levels, owing to their high fibre content and low glycemic
                index.

                Chia seeds have recently caught on in India and are being used
                more and more in our country as a superfood. A 35 g serving of
                Chia seeds contains 6 g of protein and a whopping 13 g of fibre!
                In addition to this, they are also high in nutrients such as
                calcium, magnesium and iron and also contain omega-3 fatty acids
                and numerous antioxidants that can keep you fighting fit.

                  9. High Protein Vegetables
                </h2>
                Vegetables are widely considered to just contain vitamins and
                minerals with a small number of carbohydrates and proteins.
                However, there are some vegetables that have a greater quantity
                of protein such as spinach, potatoes, broccoli, asparagus and
                even sweet potatoes. Though the quantity of protein each of
                these is not comparable to non-vegetarian sources, it still is
                quite a decent value at around 5 g per cup full of veggie
                cooked.

                </h2>
                Fruits are generally poorer sources of protein. That being said,
                fruits such as bananas, guava and certain berries have a decent
                quantity of protein in them. However, don’t rely on fruits as
                your source of protein instead, choose from one of the options

                </h2>
                Corn is one of the most cultivated crops in existence today, it
                is used for the production of corn syrup, and cornflour and used
                as a food source by itself. Sweet corn is a yummy snack to try,
                whether boiled, steamed or roasted with a delicious slathering
                of butter on top. Sweet Corn has a 3.3g protein content in every
                100g serving, along with an almost non-existent fat and no
                cholesterol.

                Milk, cheese, paneer and yogurt are excellent sources of protein
                and calcium. To get the most protein bang for your buck, choose
                cottage cheese or plain Greek yogurt. Both pack 13 grams of
                protein or more per serving, and you can dress them up with
                fruit, nuts or granola for a filling breakfast or snack.
